# Linked-Lists-Study
This C++ project is a tutorial in coding linked lists, including thorough comments detailing what each line does.

Linked Lists Basics

 - Linked list is a collection of components called nodes
   
 - Each node has two components:
		1) info - Relevant information
		2) link - Address of next node (pointer)
 
 - Address of the first node is stored in a SEPARATE location 
		~ Head or First
		~ This is NOT a node, but instead a pointer variable
 
 - Advantages of linked lists over arrays and vectors:
		~ Easily grow or shrink in size
		~ Insertion and deletion of nodes is quicker
